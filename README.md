# The-Trono-App-Series-An-OLTP-and-OLAP-System-Design
Trono is a business pilot initiative by Abdul Rafay Mohammed — a ridesharing app concept designed specifically for Torontonians. It offers fares that are consistently 10–20% lower than Uber or Lyft, guarantees zero surge pricing, and uses AI-powered smart matching to connect riders with the fastest and most cost-efficient routes.
